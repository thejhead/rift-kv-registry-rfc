                 RIFT Key/Value Structure and Registry
                     draft-ietf-rift-kv-registry-01

Abstract

   The Routing in Fat-Trees [RIFT] protocol allows for key/value pairs
   to be advertised within Key-Value Topology Information Elements (KV-
   TIEs).  The data contained within these KV-TIEs can be used for any
   imaginable purpose.  This document defines the various Key-Types
   (i.e.  Well-Known, OUI, and Experimental) and a method to structure
   corresponding values.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Description

   The Routing in Fat-Trees [RIFT] protocol allows for key/value pairs
   to be advertised within Key-Value Topology Information Elements (KV-
   TIEs).  There are no restrictions placed on the type of data that is
   contained in KV-TIEs nor what the data is used for.

   For example, it might be beneficial to advertise overlay protocol
   state from leaf nodes to the Top-of-Fabric (ToF) nodes.  This would
   make it possible to view critical state of a fabric-wide service from
   a single ToF node rather than retrieving and reconciling the same
   state from multiple leaf nodes.

2.  Key Structure

   This section describes the generic Key structure and semantics,
   Figure 1 further illustrates these components.

                   Figure 1: Generic Key-Value Structure

   *where:*

      *Key-Type:*
         A 1-byte value that identifies the Key-Type.  It MUST be a
         reserved value from the RIFT Key-Type Registry that is defined
         later in this document.

         The range of valid values is 1 - 255 (2^8-1).

         0 is an illegal value and MUST NOT be allocated to or used by
         any implementation.  It MUST be ignored on receipt.

      *Key Identifier:*
         A 3-byte value that identifies the specific key and describes
         the structure of the contained values.

         The range of valid values is 1 - 16777215 (2^24-1).

         0 is an illegal value and MUST NOT be allocated to or used by
         any implementation.  It MUST be ignored on receipt.

      *Values:*
         A variable length value that contains data associated with the
         Key Identifier.  It SHOULD contain 1 or more elements.  Whether
         the collection of elements allows duplicates and/or is ordered
         is governed by the particular Key Identifier's specification.

2.1.  Experimental Key-Type

   This section reserves a value in the RIFT Key-Type Registry to
   indicate an Experimental Key-Type.

   As shown in Figure 2, the Key-Type will be used to identify the Key-
   Type as Experimental.  The Key Identifier will be used to identify
   the specific key and describe the structure of the contained values.

2.2.  Well-Known Key-Type

   This section reserves a value in the RIFT Key-Type Registry to
   indicate Well-Known Key-Types that all implementations SHOULD
   support.

   As shown in Figure 3, the Key-Type will be used to identify the Key-
   Type as Well-Known.  The Key Identifier will be used to identify the
   specific key and describe the structure of the contained values.

2.3.  OUI Key-Type

   This section reserves a value in the RIFT Key-Type Registry to
   indicate an OUI (vendor-specific) Key-Type that any implementation
   MAY support.

   As shown in Figure 4, the Key-Type will be used to identify the Key-
   Type as OUI.  The Key Identifier MUST use the implementing
   organization's reserved OUI space to indicate the key and value
   structure.

3.  Operational Considerations

   While no restrictions are placed on Key-Value data or what it is used
   for, it is RECOMMENDED that a serialized Thrift model be used for
   simpler interoperability.  [RIFT-AUTO-EVPN] is an example of this
   type of implementation.

   Key-Value elements SHOULD NOT be used to carry topology information
   used by RIFT itself to perform distributed computations.

   In cases where KV-TIEs are flooded from north to south, policies
   SHOULD be implemented in order to avoid network-wide flooding.

   For networks with more than one ToF node, it is RECOMMENDED that
   those ToF nodes contain identical KV-TIE information when being
   distributed from north to south.  [RIFT] requires that only one KV-
   TIE is selected when identical keys are received from multiple
   northbound neighbors.  If this is not considered then the tie-
   breaking rules may cause a node to select a suboptimal KV-TIE.
   Consider a case where failure conditions cause the ToF nodes to
   become split-brained.  While the Key-Type and Key Identifier will be
   identical, the value(s) contained within may differ.  The node(s)
   receiving these differing KV-TIEs will select the one from the ToF
   node with the highest System ID, potentially leading to unintended
   effects.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section requests that IANA create two new registries the "RIFT
   Key-Type" and "RIFT Well-Known Key-Type" registries in accordance
   with [RFC8126].

   Experts reviewing requests for new values to either registry MUST
   consider the items in the Expert Review Guidance (Section 4.3)
   section.

4.3.  Expert Review Guidance

   Experts reviewing requests for values from the RIFT Key-Type Registry
   or the the the Well-Known RIFT Key-Type Registry are responsible for
   the following:

   1.  Determining the existence of a specification that clearly defines
       the purpose supporting the request and MUST contain all required
       fields for given registry.

       The document MUST also be permenent and publically available.

   2.  Ensuring that any requests are made available to the RIFT working
       group for review should the work originate from outside of the
       RIFT Working Group.

   3.  Ensuring that any work produce outside of the IETF does not
       conflict with any work that is already published or actively
       pursuing being published.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security concerns to RIFT or other
   specifications referenced in this document given that the Key-Value
   TIEs are already extensively secured by the [RIFT] protocol
   specification itself.
